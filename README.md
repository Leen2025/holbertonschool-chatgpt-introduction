# ChatGPT Introduction Project Overview

Welcome to the ChatGPT Integration Project! This initiative is designed to improve code quality and efficiency by leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities for debugging, automation, documentation, and error handling. Through hands-on activities, youâ€™ll explore how to incorporate AI into your daily programming workflow.

## Implemented by

Leen Alsaleh (inspired by materials from Holberton School)

## Project Goals

1. **Debugging**: Explore how AI can assist in detecting and fixing programming issues.
2. **Automation**: Use ChatGPT to streamline repetitive or time-consuming coding tasks.
3. **Documentation**: Enhance code clarity and maintainability by generating detailed documentation with ChatGPT.
4. **Error Handling**: Design strategies to manage invalid inputs and prevent crashes using proper error-handling techniques.

## Exercises

### 0. Debugging - Python Factorial
Troubleshoot and fix a Python script that calculates factorials.

### 1. Debugging - Python Arguments
Repair a Python program to ensure it prints only user-provided arguments, excluding the script name.

### 2. Debugging - HTML / Javascript
Fix a webpage script to change the background color when a button is clicked.

### 3. Debugging - Python Mines
Correct and enhance the Minesweeper game logic to detect a win condition when all safe cells are revealed.

### 4. Documentation - Python Factorial
Write detailed documentation for a Python factorial function, including description, inputs, and outputs.

### 5. Error Handling & Documentation - Python Checkbook
Add input validation and error management to a checkbook program, along with clear documentation.

### 6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python
Identify and resolve bugs in a Python implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game.


## Repository Structure

- **debugging**: Tasks focused on identifying and fixing code bugs
